        <h6>I said let's break up...that doesn't mean you'll accept it and disappear like it's so easy to end this!I know sometimes I act immature and say things I don't want to say and i don't feel relaxed until I express my frustration or my feelings!and
            i've told you about this...Ik I say too quickly to breakup but tbh i can't even pass 1 hour without thinking of you!But it hurts when you don't say anything and go silent even when there's so many things you should say!You may not have heart
            but I do have one and mine breaks when you don't talk to me !and it's been 1 week...</h6>
